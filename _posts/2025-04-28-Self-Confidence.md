Recently, I have been feeling deeply depressed—because of both my relationships and my research. I feel terrible about myself. Why can’t I handle things better? Why do I suffer every day? Why can’t I make progress in my research? Why can’t I solve the problems in microeconomics when I consider myself a theorist?

All of this makes me feel awful. I keep asking myself, “Why am I so bad?” It sounds like an extremely pessimistic mindset, but I’m pretty sure most PhD students experience emotions like this at least once in their lives. I’ve found some interesting videos that might help us escape this trap.
