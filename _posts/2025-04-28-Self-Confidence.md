Recently I felt great depressed. From both relationships and researches. Somehow I feel so bad for myself. Why can't I handle all those things better? Why I suffer everyday? Why can't I make progress in research? Why can't I figure out all the problems in microeconomic while I consider myself as a theorist.

All those kind made me feel so bad to myself. I always ask: why am I so bad? Sounds like a super pessimistic emotion. But I am pretty sure, most of PhD students will experience those kind of emotion at least once in the life. I found some interesting videos that may help us get out from the trap.
