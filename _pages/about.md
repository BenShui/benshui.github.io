I am a Master of Finance (prospective Ph.D. in Finance) student at the University of California, San Diego, and I previously earned my Bachelor's degree at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, majoring in Finance and Artificial Intelligence. My research interests focus on asset pricing, macro-finance, and game theory.
