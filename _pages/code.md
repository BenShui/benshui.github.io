I can use several programming languages, among which the ones I'm most familiar with are Python and MATLAB. Below are some code examples.

1. [Sample Code](#sample-code)
2. [Tutorials](#tutorials)
3. [Codes for papers](#codes-for-papers)

# Sample Code
1. Python
   + [Python_sample_code](../files/Codes/Sample_code/Python_sample_code.py)
2. MATLAB
   + [MATLAB_smaple_code](../files/Codes/Sample_code/MATLAB_sample_code.m)

# Tutorials

## Gradient Descent and Newton's Method
+ Slides: [Gradient_vs_Newton](../files/Codes/GD_vs_NT/Gradient_descent_vs_Newton_method.pdf)
+ Code(MATLAB): [GD_vs_NT](../files/Codes/GD_vs_NT/Compare.m)

# Codes for papers

Below are the links to the code and source files that can be used to replicate the results of some papers I published.
