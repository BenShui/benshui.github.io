I can use several programming languages, among which the ones I'm most familiar with are Python and MATLAB. Below are some code examples.

1. [Tutorials](#tutorials)
2. [Codes for papers](#codes-for-papers)

# Tutorials

## Gradient Descent and Newton's Method
+ Slides: [Gradient_vs_Newton](../files/Codes/GD_vs_NT/Gradient_descent_vs_Newton_method.pdf)
+ Code(MATLAB): [GD_vs_NT](../files/Codes/GD_vs_NT/Compare.m)

# Codes for papers

Below are the links to the code and source files that can be used to replicate the results of some papers I published.
