# Working papers

- **Loss Aversion with Portfolio Choice**(with Jun Liu and Kai Li).
  - This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of portfolio choice under prospect theory. We show that there is no optimal solution for half of the parameter space in which loss aversion is low. However, there always exist optimal solutions for the other half of the space. The lower bound of loss aversion above which optimal solutions exist increases without bound as asset returns become more skewed or the number of states increases. When the optimal solutions exist, their properties depend crucially on investorâ€™s initial wealth level. For example, an investor with low initial wealth seeks negative skewness and may long (short) an asset with a negative (positive) risk premium.
