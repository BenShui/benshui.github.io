# Working papers

- **[Risk Seeking](../files/paper/LA_log_normal_v6.pdf)** (with Jun Liu and Kai Li)
  - People are risk-seeking in certain situations, though they are normally risk-averse.
The loss aversion utility function provides such an example. Risk seeking is largely
understudied, probably because it usually does not allow optimal choices and are not
tractable. In this paper, we study the implications when risk seeking is incorporated
into the agent’s preferences. We show that risk seeking dramatically alters the agent’s
behaviors in stressed scenarios. It is optimal to take large long or short positions and
shun positions involving moderate levels of risk. The agent can swing between sizable
long and short positions with minor changes in market conditions. The agent may short
an asset with a positive risk premium. These behaviors are consistent with findings in
experimental and market settings but cannot be explained by risk-averse preferences.
